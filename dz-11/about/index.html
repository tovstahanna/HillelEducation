      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <p>Aniston was born on February 11, 1969, in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles to Greek-born actor
        John Aniston and actress Nancy Dow. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Louis Grieco, was from Italy. Her
        mother's other ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, and a small amount of Greek. Her father's ancestry
        is from the Greek island of Crete. Aniston has two half-brothers: John Melick, her older maternal
        half-brother; and Alex Aniston, her younger paternal half-brother. Her godfather was actor Telly Savalas, one
        of her father's best friends.

        Her family moved to New York City when she was a child. Despite her father's television career, she was
        discouraged from watching television, though she found ways around the prohibition. When she was six, she
        began attending a Waldorf school. Her parents divorced when she was nine.

        Having discovered acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school, Aniston enrolled in Manhattan's Fiorello H.
        LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society, and
        where Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher. She performed in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window by Lorraine
        Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov.</p>

      <h2>Career</h2>
      <h3>1988–1993: Beginnings</h3>
      <p>Aniston first worked in off-Broadway productions such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker's Grave, and
        supported herself with part-time jobs including work as a telemarketer, waitress and bike messenger. In 1988
        she had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film Mac and Me. The next year she
        appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem, and moved back to Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>She obtained her first regular television role on Molloy in 1990, and appeared in Ferris Bueller, a
        television adaptation of the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off; both series were quickly canceled. She
        starred as a teenager going to summer camp in the made-for-television film Camp Cucamonga (1990), and as a
        spoiled daughter followed by a vengeful leprechaun in the horror film Leprechaun (1993). A 2014 retrospective
        from Entertainment Weekly identified Leprechaun as her worst role, and Aniston herself has expressed
        embarrassment over it.</p>
      <p>Aniston also appeared in the two failed television comedy series The Edge and Muddling Through, and
        guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman's Head and Burke's Law.</p>
      <h3 id="jan-and-friends-text">1994–2004: Friends and worldwide recognition</h3>

      <p>Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles
        gas station asking for reassurance. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged her to continue acting, and a few
        months later helped cast her in <b>Friends</b>, a sitcom set to debut on NBC's 1994–1995 fall lineup. The
        producer wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller, but Courteney Cox was deemed more suitable,
        and Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live,
        but turned it down in favor of Friends. She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004, when Aniston took a
        15-year hiatus from television save for occasional guest roles.</p>
      <p>Aniston at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival
        The program was a massive hit and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition. Her
        character was especially popular. She received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting
        Actress, three for Lead Actress), and won for Lead Actress. She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards
        and won in 2003 as Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness Book of World
        Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with
        her $1 million-per-episode paycheck during the final season of Friends. Her character's relationship with Ross
        Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer, was widely popular among audiences; they were frequently voted
        television's favorite couple in polls and magazines.</p>
      <p>After a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of
        romantic comedy She's the One. Her first starring film vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), where she played a
        struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. It received mixed reviews and was
        only a moderate commercial success; but Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics
        suggesting that she had screen presence. In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by
        Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection, and the next year she starred as a restaurant
        waitress in the cult film Office Space.</p>
      <p>Aniston appeared in the dramedy Rock Star (2001) opposite Mark Wahlberg and Dominic West. She starred in the
        independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a
        commercial success in limited release, taking in over $14 million in North America. Film critic Roger Ebert
        declared it her breakthrough: After languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the
        entertaining Office Space to the disposable Picture Perfect, Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken
        with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil. It will no longer be
        possible to consider her in the same way.</p>
      <p>Aniston's biggest commercial success in film has been the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), where she played the
        girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God for one week. With a
        worldwide box office gross of $484 million, it was the fifth-highest-grossing feature film of the year.
        Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly wound newlywed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly
        (2004) opposite Ben Stiller, which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $27.7 million
        in its opening weekend; it eventually made $172 million worldwide.</p>

      <h2>Personal life</h2>
      <p>Aniston practices <a href="../gallery/index.html#jan-hatha-yoga-image"><em id="jan-hatha-yoga-text">Hatha yoga</em></a> and Budokan karate. In 2014, she spoke of her Transcendental Meditation
        practice. The following year, she revealed she has dyslexia, which had affected her education and self-esteem,
        and that after being diagnosed in her twenties, her outlook toward life changed. She stated, "I thought I
        wasn't smart. I just couldn't retain anything. Now I had this great discovery. I felt like all of my childhood
        trauma-dies, tragedies, dramas were explained."</p>
      <p>Aniston donated to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and took part in a fundraiser for Hillary
        Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. She endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>Aniston does not have any children. In July 2016, she wrote an op-ed piece for the HuffPost titled "For the
        Record", where she criticized the media for the focus on her body and speculation over potential pregnancies.
        She wrote, "The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing." In November 2022,
        she appeared on the cover of Allure for their final print issue. In the accompanying interview, Aniston said
        she had undergone IVF to try and have children when she was in her thirties and forties, but the attempts did
        not result in any pregnancies. She said, "All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really
        hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it."</p>
      <h3>Relationships</h3>
      <p>Aniston met <a href="../gallery/index.html#jan-and-brad-image"><em id="jan-and-brad-text">Brad Pitt</em></a> in 1998, and their relationship was highly publicized.
        She married Pitt, after two years of dating, on July 29, 2000, in a lavish Malibu wedding. For a few years,
        their marriage was considered the rare Hollywood success. On January 7, 2005, they announced their separation,
        and finalized their divorce on October 2. During their divorce proceedings, news media speculated that Pitt
        had been unfaithful to Aniston with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, with whom he began a
        relationship soon after the split. In the months following, the public's reaction towards the divorce was
        reported in the press, and "Team Aniston" and "Team Jolie" T-shirts appeared throughout the country. Aniston
        commented on the divorce in a January 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, stating, "Nobody did
        anything wrong... It was just like, sometimes things [happen]."</p>
      <p>In 2005, amid reports that their divorce was due to Aniston's refusal to have children with Pitt, Aniston
        said, "I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children. I did and I do and I will! ... I would never
        give up that experience for a career." Aniston said the divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother,
        Nancy, from whom she had been estranged for nearly a decade. Nancy had talked about her daughter on a
        television show and written From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir (1999). Aniston said she had been
        devastated by the death of her longtime therapist, whom she credited for helping make her separation from Pitt
        easier. She said she did not regret her relationship with Pitt, describing it as "very intense" and "a
        beautiful, complicated relationship".</p>
      <p>Aniston began a relationship with actor, director, and screenwriter <a href="../gallery/index.html#jan-and-justin-image"><em id="jan-and-justin-text">Justin Theroux</em></a> in May 2011. The following
        January, they purchased a home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles for roughly $22 million. They became
        engaged on August 10, 2012 and were married on August 5, 2015, at their estate. They separated at the end of
        2017.</p>

      <h2>In the media</h2>
      <p>Aniston is one of the world's highest-paid actresses as of 2018. She has been on the Forbes Top Earning
        Actresses list for 15 years, every year since 2001—and since then also on its Celebrity 100 list (based on
        "earnings and fame"), topping it in 2003. According to Forbes, in October 2007, <a href="../gallery/index.html#jan-with-glass-image"><em id="jan-with-glass-text">Aniston was the best-selling</em></a>
        celebrity face of the entertainment industry. The magazine estimated her net worth at $110 million in 2007,
        $150 million in 2014, and $200 million in 2017. It listed her earnings as $19.5 million in 2018.</p>
      <p>In July 2016, amidst media speculation over whether she was pregnant, Aniston penned an essay for The
        Huffington Post condemning the "objectification and scrutiny we put women through". She asserted: "We are
        complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful
        when it comes to our bodies. [...] We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine
        our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves." The piece was supported by many celebrities and widely covered in
        the media.</p>
      <p>After years of aversion to social media, Aniston joined Instagram on October 15, 2019, causing the app to
        "break" (for hours the "follow" button became inoperable due to an overload of web traffic to her account)
        with the first picture of the planned Friends cast reunion for HBO Max (whose release was delayed until 2021
        due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Within five hours and sixteen minutes, she broke the Guinness World Record for
        fastest time to reach one million followers on the platform. The record was broken in September 2020, by Sir
        David Attenborough, who achieved the same feat in 44 minutes.</p>
